=head1 DESCRIPTION

Command line utility to 'lint' biblio records based on a validation rules file.
Biblio records file must be in ISO2709 format (UTF-8). Validation rules file is
in the format described in L<MARC::Moose::Lint::Checker>. At the end of the
process, 3 files are generated: C<marc.iso.ok>, a ISO2709 file containing
biblio records that have passed the validation rules, C<marc.iso.bad>, a
ISO2709 file which contains records that have failed the validation, and
C<marc.iso.log> a text file containing a text version of the biblio records
that have failed the validation, followed by a description of the violated
rules.
